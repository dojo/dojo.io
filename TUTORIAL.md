- [ ] [Tutorial takes learner from the 'initial' demo and ends with the 'finished' one](#tutorial-takes-learner-from-the-initial-demo-and-ends-with-the-finished-one)
  - content flows naturally - all changes are described with no logical leaps- [ ] Broken into sections, each addressing one aspect of achieving tutorial's goal
- [ ] [Written with the target audience in mind](#written-with-the-target-audience-in-mind)
- [ ] [Story-arc in place](#story-arc-in-place)
  - header - Introduces the initial demo and how to get it setup. Also describes what it is missing.
  - body - Takes the learner on a journey from the initial demo to the finished one, repeatedly setting up "problems" and "solving" them as demo builds toward finished state.
