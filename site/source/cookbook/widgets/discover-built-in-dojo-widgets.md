## Objective

This recipe is a simple outline on how to familiarize yourself with the built-in Dojo 2 widgets.

## Procedure

1. View the [Dojo 2 Widget Showcase](https://dojo.github.io/examples/widget-showcase/), a live demo of all built-in widgets on one page
2. View the source code for the widget show case, for example, the main [App.ts](https://github.com/dojo/examples/blob/master/widget-showcase/src/App.ts) which renders the built-in Dojo 2 widgets
3. View the directory listing of Dojo widgets on [GitHub](https://github.com/dojo/widgets/tree/master/src)
4. View the documentation for individual widgets, for example the [Calendar widget](https://github.com/dojo/widgets/tree/master/src/calendar) has documentation for rendering and customizing the calendar widget

## Further reading:

The [Render a built-in Dojo 2 Widget](https://dojo.io/cookbook/widgets/render-built-in-dojo-widget) recipe includes minimal code to embed a built-in widget into your application.
