# Dojo 2 local installation

## Overview
This tutorial covers setup of a local Dojo 2 environment.

## Creating a Dojo Application
First, we need to create a Dojo 2 project. Dojo 2 is powerful and leverages advanced tools for creating applications. It also provides a potent command-line tool to streamline the installation process, which is installed with the following terminal command:

```bash
npm install -g @dojo/cli
```

This command installs the Dojo command-line tool (`@dojo/cli`) to simplify development tasks related to creating, testing, and building your applications. Initially, the `@dojo/cli` tool comes with three commands:
* `create` - Provides a skeleton template for Dojo 2 projects
* `eject` - Disconnects a project from `@dojo/cli` allowing advanced users to customize configuration
* `version` - Reports the version of `@dojo/cli` and any commands that are installed

In order to create your first Dojo 2 application, run the following command in the directory that will host the new application:

```bash
dojo create --name first-dojo-2-app
```

{% aside 'Dojo create arguments' %}
Many of the arguments passed to `dojo create` have abbreviated versions. So `dojo create -n first-dojo-2-app` is equivalent to `dojo create --name first-dojo-2-app`.
{% endaside %}

This command will create the basic scaffolding for a Dojo 2 application in the newly created "first-dojo-2-app" directory with all of its dependencies pre-installed.

At this point, we've successfully created our first basic Dojo 2 application and installed its dependencies. Now it is time to see what our application can do! First, we are going to leverage another `@dojo/cli` command. You don't have to install this one, it was added when you installed the other dependencies. In the terminal, enter the command:

```bash
dojo build --watch
```
 (or, the shorter, `dojo build -w`)

This command will invoke Dojo 2's tool to build and transpile the project using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a popular tool for optimizing JavaScript source code. The `--watch` (or `-w`) flag also starts a simple web server which allows us to run our application in the browser while we make modifications. Additionally, the watch flag will keep an eye on the project's files and rebuild it whenever any changes are saved.

In order to see what the application looks like, open a modern web browser (such as the latest version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari) and navigate to [`http://localhost:9999`](http://localhost:9999). You will be greeted by a humble page that welcomes you to your new application.
