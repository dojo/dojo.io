# Theming

## Overview
This tutorial will extend on previous tutorials where we created the basic biz-e-corp application. In this tutorial, we will adapt the app to allow it to be themed, then write a theme and apply it to our application. This will be done using the powerful theming system that is included in the Dojo 2 widget system.

## Prerequisites
You can [download](../assets/007_theming-initial.zip) the demo project and run `npm install` to get started.

The `@dojo/cli` command line tool should be installed globally. Refer to the [Dojo 2 local installation](../000_local_installation/) article for more information.

You also need to be familiar with TypeScript as Dojo 2 uses it extensively. For more information, refer to the [TypeScript and Dojo 2](../../docs/fundamentals/typescript_and_dojo_2/) article.

## Theming our widgets

{% task 'Theming our widgets' %}

In Dojo, we differentiate between two types of styles:

* Structural styles: these are the minimum necessary for a widget to function
* Visual styles: these are themed

The current CSS in the example app provides the structural styles, we will now review how to create and manage themes.

In order to theme our widgets, we must ensure that they each extend `ThemedMixin` and should change their top level class name to `root`. `ThemedMixin` provides a `this.theme` function for looking up class names in the provided `theme` file and applies the processed class names. We change the top level class name to `root` in order to provide a predictable way to target the outer-node of a widget.

{% instruction 'Replace the contents of `Banner.ts` with the following' %}

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/widgets/Banner.ts' lines:1-13 %}

{% aside 'Reminder' %}
If you cannot see the application, remember to run `dojo build -w` to build the application and start the development server.
{% endaside %}

This `Banner` widget will now have access to the classes in `banner.m.css` and can receive a `theme`. We use the `root` class to ensure that the theme we create can easily target the correct node.
Notice that this file and other `css` files now have a `.m.css` file extension. This is to indicate to the [Dojo 2 build system](../006_deploying_to_production/) that this file is a `css-module` and should be processed as such.

{% aside 'CSS Modules' %}
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a technique to use scoped CSS classnames by default.
{% endaside %}

{% instruction 'Create a new style sheet for the `Banner` widget named `banner.m.css`.' %}

We will create an empty `root` class for now as our base theme does not require any styles to be added to the `Banner` widget.

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/styles/banner.m.css' lang:css %}

{% instruction 'Now, let\'s look at changing the `WorkerForm` widget' %}

{% aside 'Fixed Classes' %}
Fixed classes apply styles that cannot be overridden by a theme, using a suffix is a convention that helps easily differentiate the intention of these classes.
{% endaside %}

`WorkerForm` already uses the `ThemedMixin` and has a `workerForm` class on its root node. Let's change the workerForm class to a `root` class, and while we are there, we will create a `rootFixed` class too, and apply it to the root node. Classes that are not passed to `theme` cannot be changed or overridden via a theme, ensuring that structured or nested styles are not lost when a theme is used.

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/widgets/WorkerForm.ts' lines:48-51 %}

Add the following to `workerForm.m.css`.

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/styles/workerForm.m.css' lines:1-17 lang:css %}

If you open the application in a browser its appearance and behavior should be unchanged.

{% instruction 'Now add a `root` and `rootFixed` to both `Worker.ts` and `WorkerContainer.ts`' %}

{% instruction 'When you are finished, click on toggle solution to see the results.' %}

{% solution showsolution1 %}
```typescript
// WorkerContainer.ts
// ...
render() {
    // ...
    return v('div', {
			classes: [ this.theme(css.root), css.rootFixed ]
    }, workers);
	// ...
}

// Worker.ts
// ...
render() {
    // ...
    return v('div', {
        classes: [ ...this.theme([ css.root, this._isFlipped ? css.reverse : null ]), css.rootFixed ]
    }, [
    // ...
}

```
{% endsolution %}

Next, we will start to create a theme.

{% section %}

## Creating a Theme

{% task 'Create a theme directory' %}

Let's create a `themes` directory under your project `src` to store our theme resources, and create a `dojo` theme with `theme.ts` under `src/themes/dojo/theme.ts`. This is the `theme` resource where we will import our themed CSS files and export the keyed theme for consumption by our widgets.

{% instruction 'Theme the Worker widget' %}

In order to theme the `Worker` widget, we need to create `worker.m.css` within our `theme/dojo` directory and use it within `theme.ts`. The naming here is important as the object key of the exported theme must match the naming of the widget's style sheet.

Add the following code to `theme.ts`:

``` typescript
import * as worker from './worker.m.css';
export default {
	worker
};
```

Let's start by creating a red `Worker` and observe our theme being applied correctly.

```css
/* worker.m.css */
.root {
	background: red;
}
```

To apply a theme to a widget, simply pass the `theme` as a property to widgets to have the `ThemedMixin` applied. To ensure that the entire application applies the `theme` it needs to be passed to all the themed widgets in our application. This can become problematic when an application uses a mixture of themed and non-themed widgets, or uses a widget from a third party, meaning that there is no guarantee that the `theme` will be propagated as required.

{% aside 'What is a registry?' %}
A registry provides a mechanism to inject external payloads into widgets throughout the application tree. To learn more, take a look at the [container tutorial](../1010_containers_and_injecting_state/) and [registry tutorial](../1020_registries/).
{% endaside %}

However an application can automatically inject a `theme` from the `registry` to every themed widget in an application tree. First, create a `themeInjector` using the `registerThemeInjector` function by passing a `registry` instance and `theme`. This will return a handle to the `themeInjector` that can be used to change the theme using `themeInjector.set()`, which will invalidate all themed widgets in the application tree and re-render using the new theme!

{% instruction 'Update our `main.ts` file to import our theme and create a `themeInjector`.' %}

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/main.ts' %}

Open the application in your web browser and see that the `Worker` backgrounds are now `red`.

{% instruction 'Use variables and complete the Worker theme' %}

The [Dojo 2 build system](../006_deploying_to_production/) supports new CSS features such as `css-custom-properties` by using PostCSS to process our `.m.css` files. We can use these new CSS features to add variables to `worker.m.css` and complete its theme.
Let's create `themes/dojo/variables.css` (notice that this file does not have a `.m.css` extension as it is not a `css-module` file).

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/themes/dojo/variables.css' lang:css %}

In the above code you can see that we have created a number of CSS Custom Properties to be used within our theme and wrapped them in a `:root` selector which makes them available on the global scope within our `css-modules`.
To use them, we can `@import` the `variables.css` file and use the `var` keyword to assign a `css-custom-property` to a css rule.

Now we will use these variables in `worker.m.css` to create our fully themed `Worker`.

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/themes/dojo/worker.m.css' lang:css %}

{% section %}

## Theming Dojo widgets

Thus far in this tutorial, we have themed our custom `Worker` widget, but we have not targeted Dojo widgets that are contained within our application. To demonstrate the styling of Dojo widgets, we will theme the `workerForm` widget as it contains both DOM nodes and Dojo widgets.

{% instruction 'Let\'s create `workerForm.m.css`' %}

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/themes/dojo/workerForm.m.css' lang:css %}

{% instruction 'And include it in `theme.ts`' %}

``` typescript
import * as worker from './worker.m.css';
import * as workerForm from './workerForm.m.css';
export default {
	worker,
	workerForm
};
```

This should be familiar from theming the `Worker` in the previous section. To theme the Dojo 2 `TextInput` within our `WorkerForm`, we need to create `dojoTextInput.m.css` and export it from `theme.ts` using a theme key prefixed with `dojo-`. The dojo prefix helps ensure that the Dojo widget theme keys do not clash with application widget theme keys.

{% instruction 'Create `dojoTextInput.m.css`' %}

{% include_codefile 'demo/finished/biz-e-corp/src/themes/dojo/dojoTextInput.m.css' lang:css %}

{% instruction 'And export it from `theme.ts`' %}

``` typescript
import * as worker from './worker.m.css';
import * as workerForm from './workerForm.m.css';
import * as dojoTextInput from './dojoTextInput.m.css';
export default {
	worker,
	workerForm,
	'dojo-textinput': dojoTextInput
};
```

Notice the styling rule for the `.root` selector? Here we are introducing another powerful part of the Dojo 2 theming system, `composes`. Composes originates in the [`css-module` specification](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#composition), allowing you to apply styles from one class selector to another. Here we are specifying that the `root` of a `TextInput` (the label text in this case), should appear the same as the `nameLabel` class in our `WidgetForm`. This approach can be very useful when creating multiple themes from a `baseTheme` and avoids repetitive redefinition of style rules.

In your web browser you will see the `TextInput` widgets at the top of the form have been styled.

{% instruction 'Create a theme resource for the Dojo Button' %}

Create a theme resource for the Dojo `Button` within `WidgetForm` following the same pattern within this tutorial.

{% instruction 'When you are finished, click on toggle solution to see the results.' %}

{% solution showsolution2 %}
``` css
@import './variables';

.root {
	height: 38px;
	border: 1px solid var(--input-border);
	background: var(--card);
	color: var(--accent);
	font-size: 16px;
	font-weight: bold;
	padding: 8px;
	min-width: 150px;
	vertical-align: bottom;
}
```
{% endsolution %}
